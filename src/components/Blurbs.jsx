    `My brother and I wanted to collaborate on a project, and us both being 
    environmentalists at heart, we decided to build an air quality monitoring 
    app. The end goal is to create a platform where users can compare air 
    quality measurements they personally took with air quality data provided by 
    government agencies. We first started with building the data pipeline and 
    data visualization tool that you see linked here. We used Apache 
    Airflow to orchestrate our ELT data pipeline. Our api is built with FastAPI, 
    and the front end is rendered with React. Click `,

    `*UPDATED: This project was previously written in Python, but as an exercise
    I rewrote it in Go! Checkout the new version :)
    The inspiration for this project came from Chancho the chinchilla. He's a 
    15 year old chinchilla who is very particular about the climate around him. 
    Chinchillas generally don't tolerate temperatures outside the range of 60-75 
    degrees Farenheit. Thus, I created this app as a way to monitor the 
    temperature of the apartment when my partner and I are away. I used a 
    Raspberry Pi with a temperature sensor to get the temperature data, which 
    is then posted to my database via my api. The app then pulls the data to 
    render a webpage with a view of the data. The tech stack includes Go, Gin, 
    MYSQL, Docker, and Nginx. It's deployed on my personal VPS. Click `,
